# xlsxwriter-scm
chicken-scheme libxlsxwriter bindings

uses easyffi, data-structures eggs, build file uses posix and s eggs

utilizes libz, libxslxwriter c libraries.

run build.sh, bin folder will contain compiled files, 
(use xlsxwriterscm)

Very basic functionality is good to go and tested, but I will work on documenting and testing everything.
In the mean time check source files, the /tests folder for examples as well as the documentation of libxlsxwriter https://libxlsxwriter.github.io/ 

This is released under same license as libxlsxwriter (FreeBSD).
